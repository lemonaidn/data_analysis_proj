This is the repository for Aidan, Caley, and Aya's Data Analysis Project for JOUR472/772.

We have chosen to analyze House Office Expenditure Data. 

In addition to reviewing the data for cleanliness, summary/high-level statistics, and any unexpected or unusual values, we wanted to answer the following questions:

1) Do US reps from DC, Maryland and Virginia spend less on average than their colleagues? It seems logical that they would spend significantly less at least on travel, but is that the case? If so, does that mean they spend less overall, or do they outspend their peers in other categories?
2) Which political party does the most spending, and does that change with whether or not that party holds the majority in the House?
3) Did the most common categories of spending change during COVID? For example, were members spending less on office equipment while everyone was working remotely? Or did they perhaps spend more on franked mail to communicate with constituents during isolation?
4) Which offices in the House are spending the least annually? There may be an interesting story behind lawmakers who have shown restraint in spending their budgets compared to colleagues.
5) Has staff pay kept on pace with wage growth nation-wide? The Federal Times has reported on this question, but we think it would be well-suited for data visualization.

Quarterly expenditure data was downloaded from https://projects.propublica.org/represent/expenditures

House member data originates from ProPublica's Congress API https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/ which requires an API key.
